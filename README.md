# This is my first GIT repository

> Not true... actually

This is an exercise for the 2024 IPGP Git Class.

I feel like I like GIT ðŸ™‚.

I would like to add a GIF.... let's find one on the web

This should be a non-conflicting modification.
I'm just adding a couple of lines, after all.

Bye bye and thanks for reading this file ðŸ™‚

I was kidding: there is more to read ðŸ˜œ

I'm getting tired of modifying this file... ðŸ¥±
One last local modification...

Maybe not...
