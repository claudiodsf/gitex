# The Blaze - Dancehall

## Claudio S.

The Blaze are a Paris-based ambient electronic dance music duo consisting of
two cousins, Guillaume and Jonathan Alric. Their method involves producing
sound and visuals at the same time, creating a strong link between music and
image. They have released two albums, Dancehall (2018) and Jungle (2023), as
well as one EP, Territory (2017).

Dancehall is their debut studio album.
Beginning with the vibrant, piano-accented 'Opener' and continuing through
heartfelt tracks like 'She' and 'Queens,' there's an unmistakable aura of
love and brightness emanating throughout. This positive vibe is captivating,
serving as yet another testament to 2018 being an exceptional year for
outstanding dance albums.
